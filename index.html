<h2> Information</h2>

<p2>
The franchise was originally created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1996, he originally made the game from his hobby of collecting insects, he originally came up with this idea in 1990 after seeing the Game Boy which was made 
by nintendo and the ability to communicate between them via the cable, he pitched the idea to the Nintendo who you didn't really grasp the idea but were they decided to explore the concept as Satoshi had a good 
reputation for game desing, it took 6 years to the the very first game's the pokemon red and blue, in this process Game Freak nearly went bankrupt to develop the game luckily Creature INC invested into the game 
in return they would receive one-third of the franchise right.

Very few media payed attention to the franchise as such Satoshi feared that Nintendo would reject the games, but over time the 
sales were increased until, the franchise found itself as one of the best selling games among Nintendo's top franchises such as 
Mario, he would continue being involved in the more modern Pokemon Games as well.

Satoshi saw Shigeru Miyamoto as a major influence, because of this he develpoed a style closely to his, he grew inspiration from
olf Japanese shows and anime such as Godzilla and Ultraman
